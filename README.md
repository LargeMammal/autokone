Carputer made with Raspberry Pi, Linux, Microstack GPS module and gpsd.

## Main objective
Main objective of this project is to create carputer based on Raspberry Pi.

## Modules
The whole project is planned around the idea that I myself maintain as little as possible.

### GPS
I used Microstack GPS module. I got one from school so I built my system on that. This limited my system build on microstack libraries or gpsd. I chose gpsd because I could then use Navia. Which allowed me to code as little as possible. This also limited maintanance requirements.

### OBD
I plan to gather data from my car with OBD-II cable. I had one but it was stolen. So I'm back to square one.

## Testing
Testing will be specific to my project. But I'll try to abstract as much as possible.
